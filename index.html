            Hello! My name is <strong>Josh-Ryan</strong> but people just call me
            <em><strong>Josh</strong></em>. Before coming to the CIT program here
            at BCIT, I studied <strong>computing science</strong> at
            <strong>SFU</strong> for <strong>2 years</strong>. I have always been
            interested in everything computers, a fun fact about me is that I put
            together my own computer because it was more cost efficient to do so,
            and I figured it would be a fun learning experience as well.

            Some of my <em>hobbies</em> include but are not limited to gaming,
            watching anime, typing, and learning Japanese. To end this, I'd like to
            mention another fun fact about myself. That fun fact being that I type
            somewhat competitively, I have attended a couple of
            <strong>online typing competitions</strong> in which I have always been
            able to make it to either the <strong>best of 8</strong> or
            <strong>best of 16</strong> rounds. I started my typing journey with a
            measly average of <strong>30wpm with 85% accuracy</strong>, to where I
            am now being able to type with an average of
            <strong>140wpm with 96% accuracy</strong>. Thank you for taking the time
            to read this paragraph about me.
